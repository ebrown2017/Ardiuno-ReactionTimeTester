# Ardiuno-ReactionTimeTester

This project tests a users reaction time by having them press a button after a LED turns on. The LED will turn on between random intervals of 2-10 seconds. The LED will initally turn green but will quickly fade to red if the user takes too long to press. If the user fails to press the button a message will output saying they need to try again. If the button is correctly pushed in the alloted time, a message will display stating their reaction time in milliseconds. There is then a 5 second timer in which the game "resets" after a failed or sucessful button push.
